# Libs

This section documents meta processes by the Libs team.

## Where to find us

The libs team hangs out primarily in [the rust-lang Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/) these days in the `#t-libs` stream.

The `#rustc` IRC channel on `irc.mozilla.org` is in a "quasi-deprecated" status and is not recommended.
