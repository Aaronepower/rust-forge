# Rust Blog guidelines

## Context

The Rust project maintains two blogs. The “main blog” (blog.rust-lang.org) and a “team blog”. This document provides the guidelines for what it takes to write a post for each of those blogs, as well as how to propose a post and to choose which blog is most appropriate.

## How to select the right blog: audience

So you want to write a Rust blog post, and you’d like to know which blog you should post it on? Ultimately, there are three options:


- The main Rust blog
    - Suitable when your audience is “all Rust users or potential users”
    - Written from an “official position”, even if signed by an individual
- The team Rust blog
    - Suitable when your audience is “all Rust contributors or potential contributors”
    - Written from an “official position”, even if signed by an individual
- Your own personal blog
    - Everything else

There are two key questions to answer in deciding which of these seems right:

- Am I speaking in an “official capacity” or as a “private citizen”?
- Who is the audience for your post?

In general, if you are speaking as a “private citizen”, then you are probably best off writing on your own personal blog.

If however you are writing in an **official capacity**, then one of the Rust blogs would be good fit. Note that this doesn’t mean you can’t write as an individual. Plenty of the post’s on Rust’s blog are signed by individuals, and in fact that is the preferred option. However, those posts are typically documenting the official position of a team — a good example is Aaron Turon’s classic post on [Rust’s language ergonomics initiative](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/03/02/lang-ergonomics.html). Sometimes, the posts are describing an exciting project, but again in a way that represents the project as a whole (e.g., ManishGoregaokar’s report on [Fearless Concurrency in Firefox Quantum](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/11/14/Fearless-Concurrency-In-Firefox-Quantum.html)).

To decide between the main blog and the team blog, the question to ask yourself is **who is the audience** for your post. Posts on the main blog should be targeting **all** Rust users or potential users — they tend to be lighter on technical detail, and written without requiring as much context. Posts on the team blog can assume a lot more context and familiarity with Rust.

## Writing for the Main Rust blog

The core team ultimately decides what to post on the main Rust blog.

Post proposals describing exciting developments from within the Rust org are welcome, as well as posts that describe exciting applications of Rust. We do not generally do “promotional cross-posting” with other projects,  however.

If you would like to propose a blog post for the main blog, please reach out to a [core team member](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/core). It is not suggested to just open PRs against the main Rust blog that add posts without first discussing it with a core team member.

## Team Rust blogs

Teams can generally decide for themselves what to write on the team Rust blog. 

Typical subjects for team Rust blog posts include:

- New initiatives and calls for participation
- Updates and status reports from ongoing work
- Design notes

To propose a blog post for the team blog of a particular team, simply reach out to the team lead or some other team representative.
