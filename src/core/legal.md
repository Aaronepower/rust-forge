# Legal counsel

Some of the matters handled by the Rust Project (for example, legal policies or
DMCA takedowns) require legal counsel to be handled effectively. Mozilla is
providing legal counsel for such matters, and this page documents how to access
it.

## How to request counsel

Team members can email Niko Matsakis (`nmatsakis AT mozilla DOT com`) with
their inquiry, and the request will be forwarded to Mozilla Legal. Due to an
internal Mozilla policy, team members won't be CCed in the conversation with
the lawyers, but they will receive a summary of the discussion and the outcome
after the matter is resolved.
