# Compiler-team Triage Meeting

## What is it?

The triage meeting is a weekly meeting where we go over the open
issues, look at regressions, consider beta backports, and other such
business. In the tail end of the meeting, we also do brief check-ins
with active working groups to get an idea what they've been working
on.

## When and where is it?

See the [compiler team meeting calendar][c] for the canonical date and
time. The meetings take place in the #t-compiler stream on the
[rust-lang Zulip][z].
